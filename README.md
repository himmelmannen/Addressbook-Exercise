# Addressbook-Exercise
Learning and Practicing Shell Scripting

I have been studying shell scripting on a website called https://www.shellscript.sh/. At the end of the course, Addressbook exercise is the one that is considered to be useful in working out shell scripting.

Followings are the things that I benefited, learnt and practiced most in the course:

  1-Functions to perform required taks.
  2-Writing menu-based application.
  3-Input validations as much as possible.
  4-Making an application as interactive as it could be.
  5-Using regular expressions
  6-Giving explanations as much as possible using comments.
  7-Commonly used utilities like sed, awk and grep.
  8-Vi text editor.
